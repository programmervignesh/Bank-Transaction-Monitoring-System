 ****🏦 Bank Transaction Monitoring System****

**📘 Overview**

The Bank Transaction Monitoring System is a Python and SQL-based project designed to manage, monitor, and analyze financial data in a simulated banking environment.
It focuses on tracking customer details, account relationships, and transaction patterns to identify key insights such as spending behavior, account activity, and financial performance.

By integrating Python with SQL (SQLite3), the system provides a reliable and efficient way to perform data storage, retrieval, and analysis through well-structured relational databases and analytical SQL queries.
